## Postman, APIs, and requests

Later, when we begin to code our Azure Function, we are going to need to test it. How? By sending requests to the endpoint just like the web app is going to.

**Since our Azure Function will be taking a picture in the request, we are going to be using *Postman* to test it**

You can install it from the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en) as a Chrome extension or sign up on the [website](https://identity.getpostman.com/signup?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.postman.co%2Fbuild&_ga=2.250229059.455314589.1604370309-1702490.1602596646https://identity.getpostman.com/signup?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.postman.co%2Fbuild&_ga=2.250229059.455314589.1604370309-1702490.1602596646)


*What will Postman do?*
> We are going to use Postman to send a POST request to our Azure Function to test if it works, mimicking what our static website will do.
> Our HTTP trigger Azure Function will be an [API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY) that receives requests and sends back information.

To introduce you to sending requests to an API and how Postman works, we'll be sending a POST request to an API. *I will be demoing in the web version*
